    <h2>Description</h2>

    <p>Pasta a la Jack is a tomato based pasta dish, created by esteemed chef Jack Bzowski.</p>
    <p>Utterly delicious yet with only a handful of ingredients, it makes for a perfect work night dinner.</p>

    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>Tomatoes (1kg)</li>
        <li>Italian sausages (6)</li>
        <li>Garlic cloves (6)</li>
        <li>Pasta of choice (500g)</li>
        <li>Olive oil (1 tbsp)</li>
        <li>Basil (a few sprigs)</li>
        <li>Parmesan (to taste)</li>
        <li>Salt and pepper to taste</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>Run a knife down the entire length of each sausage and peel off each casing.</li>
        <li>Fry the sausages in olive oil in a big pot, making sure to mash the sausages as best you can.</li>
        <li>While the sausages are frying, core and quarter each tomato and peel the garlic cloves.</li>
        <li>Once the sausage is sufficiently browned, remove it, crush and fry the garlic in the remaining oil for 1 minute.</li>
        <li>Add all of the tomatoes to the pot and fry/mash for 20 minutes or so until completely broken down (add more olive oil if necessary).</li>
        <li>Once the tomatoes are fully broken down, add the sausages, basil, and 2 cups of water to the pot. Leave simmering for an hour, stirring every 15 mins or so.</li>
        <li>Once 10 minutes remains, start cooking your pasta of choice in a separate pot in heavily salted water.</li>
        <li>One minute before the pasta's recommended cooking time has passed, drain the pasta and preserve the pasta water. </li>
        <li>Check the sauce and add salt, pepper and parmesan to taste.</li>
        <li>Add the pasta to the sauce pot and cook it in the sauce for an extra minute. Add a few splashes of the reserved pasta water</li>
    </ol>
